# GoogleTest adapter README

Allows viewing all GoogleTests in a tree view, and running/debugging them.

## Features

This extension presents all GoogleTests in your application in a tree view. The developer can then run/debug any of these tests.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `gtest-adapter.debugConfig`: The name of the debug configuration which defines the GTest test application, and how to debug it.

* `gtest-adapter.supportLocation`: Used internally by the extension to know if navigating  to the code is supported. The extension will manage the value of this setting automatically, and will decide whether to offer the "Go to Code" option in the popup menu.

## Known Issues

* There is no way to navigate from a tree leaf to the corresponding test, if you are using older versions of GoogleTest (more information about GoogleTest versions [here](/GoogleTestVersion.md)).
