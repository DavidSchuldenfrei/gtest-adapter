# GoogleTest adapter README

Allows viewing all GoogleTests in a tree view, and running/debugging them.

## Features

This extension presents all GoogleTests in your application in a tree view. The developer can then run/debug any of these tests.

## Usage

This extension is standalone, and doesn't depend on any other extensions. To use this extension, you must first define a "Debug" configuration in `launch.json` to debug your GoogleTests, and then set this for your tests `debugConfig`.  

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `gtest-adapter.debugConfig`: The name of the debug configuration which defines the GTest test application, and how to debug it.

* `gtest-adapter.showCodeLens`: Determines whether to show the CodeLens test status or not. Default is true

* `gtest-adapter.refreshAfterBuild`: Determines whether to automatically refresh the test tree after each build. Default is true

* `gtest-adapter.gotoTestTitle`: Used for localization. Title for [Go To Test] in CodeLens. 

* `gtest-adapter.runTitle`: Used for localization. Title for [Run] in CodeLens. 

* `gtest-adapter.debugTitle`: Used for localization. Title for [Debug] in CodeLens. 

* `gtest-adapter.supportLocation`: Used internally by the extension to know if navigating  to the code is supported. The extension will manage the value of this setting automatically, and will decide whether to offer the "Go to Code" option in the popup menu.

## Known Issues

* There is no way to navigate from a tree leaf to the corresponding test, if you are using versions of GoogleTest prior to version [1.8.1](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/release-1.8.1). (more information about GoogleTest versions [here](/GoogleTestVersion.md))

* Codelens isn't available , if you are using versions of GoogleTest prior to version [1.8.1](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/release-1.8.1). (more information about GoogleTest versions [here](/GoogleTestVersion.md))

* Codelens isn't updated when changes are made to the code. To refresh Codelens, you need to rebuild the googletest application , and refresh the tests tree.
